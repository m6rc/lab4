2. The install worked successfully! Congratulations!
3. '/' returns 404. '/polls' redirects to '/polls/' and renders html (Hello, world...)
4. They're files that contain instructions for the db on how to create the db tables based on the models.
    They're useful because you can change models without having to change the database yourself.
5. A view of your models and data. You can get models in the admin page by registering them in admin.py.
6. "You're looking at question 38."
"You're looking at the results of question 38."
"You're voting on question 38."
using a string returns a 404.
This can be fixed by removing 'int:' from the 'question_id' paramter.
7. It can cause issues if you want to change the url for a page.
You then need to find all the hardcoded urls and manully change them.
8. More readable code, easier to debug, documented, less boilerplate ...
You should use generic views when the generic view provides what you want.
If you want more control over your views then you can make your own.
